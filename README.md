#The book Cormen studied and presented for educational purposes
#The book is divided into chapters.
#Chapter 1: Assumes that you are already aware of the importance of studying algorithms. The attempt is to teach and learn algorithms in a disciplined manner.
#We wil use C++, Java and Python 

#Random Access Model: A single process computer model assumed to analyze algorithms. RAM model
#Limit on size of each word of data: (c lg n) n is the value of the integer that the word can hold. c is a constant c >= 1. 
#c is constant because the model restricts a word to not grow arbitrarily in size.

#Insertion sort:

#While going through an array from beginning to end, we place each element at appropriate positions in the array.
